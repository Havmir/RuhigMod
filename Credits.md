# Credits:

I'd like to take the time to thank the Cobalt Core modding community for their continued effort to help me develop this mod, as if it wasn't for them, I likely would've had started this project nor would I have likely finished it. I would also like to give a special thanks to rft50, for the many hours they spent helping learn how to code and troubleshooting the many many coding hurdles I came accross.

In addition to rft50, I'd like to also give a thanks to:
